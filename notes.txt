Requirements
1. Database Persistance
Persist data using a PostgreSQL database.

Use CRUD methods to manipulate data in the database.

2. Project Planning
Think through your project, researching the API documentation, project features, what data you will store, and how it will be used in your web application.

Draw a database diagram on draw.io and plan out any relationships.

Think through the PostgreSQL command you will need to write to create the schema for your database.

3. Project Setup
Set up a new Node.js project using Express.js.

Include pg for working with your localhost PostgreSQL database.

Include EJS for templating.

Create a frontend in HTML CSS JS.

Ensure that the project has a structured directory and file organization.

4. API Integration
Implement at least a GET endpoint to interact with your chosen API.

Use Axios to send HTTP requests to the API and handle responses.

5. Data Presentation
Design the application to present the book covers from the API and the data in your database a in a user-friendly way.

Use appropriate HTML, CSS, and a templating engine like EJS.

Think about how you would allow the user to sort the data from the database.

6. Error Handling
Ensure that error handling is in place for both your application and any API requests. You can console log any errors, but you can also give users any user-relevant errors.

7. Documentation
Include comments throughout your code to explain your logic.

8. Code Sharing
Use what you have learnt about GitHub to commit and push your project to GitHub so that you can share it with other students in the Q&A area, I'd love to see what you've build too! You can tweet at me @yu_angela

Include a Readme.md file that explains how to start your server, what commands are needed to run your code. e.g. npm i  and then nodemon index.js
